🧠 ReputationBoard: Onchain DAO Reputation System

A plug-and-play Solana smart contract for tracking wallet-based reputation points — with token-gated voting, cooldowns, leaderboards, role unlocks, and score decay.



 🔧 Use Cases

DAOs & Guilds: Reward active contributors with points and unlock special roles.
Token Communities: Allow token holders to upvote/downvote peers.
Onchain Games: Track player merit and progress over time.
Hackathons & Bounties: Let teams rate each other post-event.

⚙️ How It Works

1. Token-Gated Voting

   Only SPL token holders can vote.
   Each wallet can upvote/downvote others with cooldown timers (e.g., once every 24h).

2. Reputation Points

 Points are tracked on-chain by wallet address.
 Users gain or lose points based on community votes.

3. Cooldowns & Abuse Prevention

   Voting frequency is limited to prevent sybil/spam behavior.

4. Leaderboards

 View top N contributors with live rankings.

5. Role Unlocks

 Reach score thresholds (e.g., 100 pts) to auto-unlock DAO roles.

6. Decay & Resets

   Optional weekly decay (e.g., -10%) keeps rankings fresh.
   Admins can reset all scores for seasonal use.



 🧩 How DAOs Can Plug It In

1. Deploy the Program using Anchor on Solana.
2. Set Your SPL Token for voting eligibility.
3. Define Roles & Threshold (e.g., “Core Contributor” at 500 pts).
4. Integrate Frontend

 Use leaderboards, scores, and role data in your app or UI.
Reputation data can be exported to badges, ranks, or Discord roles.
